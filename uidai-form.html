     <h2>Full Form Of Uidai:</h2>
     
     <p><a href="#">Uidai full form</a> is Unique Identification Authority of India. Uidai is an acronym for the Unique Identification Authority of India. As a government body, it oversees the <a href="#">eadharcard</a> system, which was created to issue a unique identity number to every individual of India in order to eradicate duplicate and fictitious identities.</p>
     
     <p>India's Unique Identification Authority (UIDAI) was formed to give "Aadhaar" numbers to all residents. To eliminate duplicate and fake identities, the UID had to be robust enough.</p>
     
      <p>By law, UIDAI is responsible for Aadhaar enrolment and authentication, including operation and management of Aadhaar life cycle, developing policy, procedure, and system for issuing Aadhaar numbers to individuals, and performing authentication and ensuring the security of identity information, including personal authentication records.</p>

    <h3>Why is Uidai:</h3>

     <p>Uniqueness, Authentication, Financial Address, and e-KYC of the Aadhaar identity platform enable the Government of India to directly approach residents in the delivery of different subsidies, benefits, and services by utilizing the resident's Aadhaar number only. Know about the full form of UIdai is Unique Identification Authority of India.</p>

     <h3>Uidai Full Form & Features:</h3>

      <p>"<strong>Uidai full form is Unique Identification Authority of India</strong>"</p>
      
      <h4>Uidai Features:</h4>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Population and biometric data are de-duplicated in order to attain this goal. Demographic and biometric information gathered during enrolling is compared to records in the UIDAI database to determine if a resident has previously been added to that database. After de-duplication, just one Aadhaar will be produced for each person that enrolls. Enrollment will be denied if the resident enrolls more than once.</li>
        <li><strong>VRandom number:</strong> Unintelligent and random, the Aadhaar number lacks any kind of intelligence. Participants must supply minimum demographic and biometric information throughout the enrollment process. The enrolling procedure includes a brief questionnaire. When enrolling in Aadhaar, you aren't asked to provide information such as your caste or religion or income or health, or location.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology architecture that is scalable:</strong> As a result, the UID design is both flexible and extensible. This information is maintained in a central location, and authentication may be done online from any location within this enormous landmass. There are 100 million Aadhaar authentications a day, and the service is designed to manage that many.</li>
        <li><strong>Open source technologies:</strong> In order to grow, the open-source design does not rely on specific hardware, storage, operating systems, or database vendors. This type of application is created using open technologies and is designed for scalability in a vendor-neutral way, allowing heterogeneous hardware to reside within the same application.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Who is the CEO of UIDAI?</h4>
        
        <p>The Uidai of CEO is  Saurabh Garg. Unified Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) Chief Executive Officer was appointed on Thursday as part of a bureaucratic restructuring by the Centre. Garg is now serving in the state of Odisha, where he hails from.</p>

In addition, he was appointed to the newly established office of Chairman of the UIDAI, which was comparable in rank to that of a Cabinet minister. As of April 2010, Nilekani unveiled the Aadhaar logo and brand name.</p>
     
     <h4>What is aadhaar seeding?</h4>
     
     <p>Aadhaar seeding is a procedure in which citizens' Aadhaar numbers are entered into a service provider's (in this case, a bank's) service delivery database to enable database de-duplication and Aadhaar-based authentication during service delivery. Uidai full form is Unified Identification Authority of India and Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identifying number issued on behalf of the Indian government by the Unique Identification Authority of India.</p>

     <ol>

On the other hand, the UIDAI's official website allows you to obtain e-cards, which are copies of your original Aadhaar card that may be printed or downloaded in pdf format.</li>
         <li>There will be a 14-digit Aadhaar unique identifier assigned to you as confirmation that you are an Indian citizen. This means that you can use an e-Aadhaar in place of your Aadhaar card in any country. An Aadhaar card might take up to three months to arrive following enrolment in the program. This means that in the interim, e-Aadhar can be utilized.</li>
         <li>Both the Aadhar card and the E-Aadhar card can be used as proof of identity in any government or private agency.</li>
         <li>It's a physical copy that might go lost. While the E-Aadhar card is a password-protected pdf file.</li>
        </ol>
     
     <h5>Does the Aadhar card have an expiry date?</h5>
     
     <p>As soon as you receive your Aadhaar card in the mail, it is valid for the rest of your life. In the case of minors, the Aadhaar card is blue in color and is called Baal Aadhaar for children under the age of five.</p>

The Full form of Uidai is Unique Identification Authority of India, For Aadhaar, only the child's image is taken, and no other information is collected about them.
