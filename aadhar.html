            <h3>What is the role of E-AADHAR in India?</h3>
            <p>In today's time, the aadhar card has become one of the most important parts of the Indian people. This is
              considered as the certificate of the Identification document, but it has so many other features besides
              that. This eaadharcard is widely used in public and private departments.</p>
            <p>You can use this at the time of transaction, banking and property purchase. This eaadhar card detail
              contains biometric information and other personal details. The card is issued by the UIDAI that everyone
              should create. In the further section, we are going to share how many times an individual can <a
                href="file:///C:/Users/hanumant/Desktop/Project/Eaadhar-card/update-aadhar-card.html">update aadhaar
                card</a> and change their information and how to download this.</p>

            <h4>How many times can a person change the information of aadhar?</h4>
            <p>As per the UIDAI, the individuals can change their name on the e aadhar a maximum of two times. In case
              you want to change the date of birth, you can only change this if there is a difference of three years
              between the original date of issue of the card.</p>
            <p>If it is more than that, you can not change the information in eaadharcard. When it comes to the address,
              you can change this for one time. Similar to that, you can also change the gender only one time. Apart
              from these things if you want to change any other information like mobile number, then you need to visit
              the nearest e aadhar card centre. To change all the above things you can visit our site by paying a little
              cost.</p>

            <h4>Is it possible to renew the e Aadhaar Card?</h4>
            <p>Does the aadhar card is valid for a lifetime? Is it necessary to update or renew this timely? Once an
              Aadhaar Card is issued to you, there is no need to renew. The eaadhar card is valid for a lifetime, in
